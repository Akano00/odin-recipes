    <h3 class="content-h3">Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the meatballs: combine the meat, eggs, breadcrumbs, parmesan,
        garlic, parsley, salt, pepper and a splash of milk in a mixing bowl. Mix
        together well, using your hands. Roll into 25 1½-inch balls and place on
        a cookie sheet. Place the cookie sheet into the freezer for 5 to 10
        minutes to firm up.
      </li>
      <li>
        To brown the meatballs, heat the olive oil in a heavy pot or large
        skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs, about eight at a time,
        turning to brown on all sides (they’ll finish cooking in the sauce
        later). Remove and drain on a paper towel-lined plate after each batch.
        Set meatballs aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the sauce: in the same pot, add the onions and garlic and cook
        for a few minutes, or until translucent. Pour in crushed tomatoes, whole
        tomatoes with their juices and wine, if using. Add the red pepper flakes
        (as desired), parsley, salt, pepper and sugar. Stir to combine and cook
        over medium heat for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the meatballs to the pot and stir gently into the sauce. Reduce the
        heat to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, stirring very gently a couple
        of times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before serving, stir in the basil, if using. Serve over cooked
        spaghetti and sprinkle with extra parmesan.
      </li>
    </ol>

      I love—I mean love—making spaghetti and meatballs. Oh, don’t get me
      wrong—I love eating it, too. But if I had to choose forever between
      cooking it and eating it…well, wait a minute. I don’t know which I’d
      choose. Never eating spaghetti and meatballs again in my life would be
      pretty devastating. What I’m trying to say in a roundabout, backward,
      incoherent, motormouthed way is that I derive a great deal of satisfaction
      from cooking spaghetti and meatballs. There’s just something about the
      mixing of the meatballs, the forming them into compact little rounds, the
      browning them in the same pot in which you’ll eventually add the sauce
      ingredients, the adding of the meatballs to the sauce. The steady simmer,
      during which the meatballs impart their flavor to the sauce.
