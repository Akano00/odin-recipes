    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti and meatballs is an Italian-American pasta dish consisting of
      spaghetti, tomato sauce, and meatballs. Originally inspired by similar
      dishes from southern Italy, the modern version of spaghetti and meatballs
      was developed by Italian immigrants in New York City. It grew in
      popularity during the first half of the 20th century and is today
      considered a classic in Italian-American cuisine both in New York City and
      the rest of the U.S

      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>
          In a large stock pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add Italian
          sausage, beef chunks, sausage links, onion, and garlic: cook and stir
          until meat is thoroughly done. Stir in tomato paste, crushed tomatoes,
          bay leaves, and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer
          sauce over low heat for 1 hour.

        <strong>step 2</strong>
        <p>
          In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck beef, eggs, bread, Romano
          cheese, salt and pepper, and a pinch of parsley flakes. Shape into
          golf ball size meatballs.

          Pour vegetable oil into a large skillet. Add meatballs, and cook over
          medium heat until lightly browned. Place meatballs in spaghetti sauce,
          and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.
