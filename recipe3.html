    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 0;">
      Spaghetti and Meatballs is an Italian – American dish which typically
      consists of Mincemeat, Tomato Sauce and Spaghetti. Spaghetti and Meatballs
      is absolutely delicious and very easy to whip up. Now, this recipe is not
      a typical Italian take, but more of a Nigerian twist. I personally do not
      like Tomato sauces as I always find them a bit sour and no matter how well
      they’re cooked, it’s almost impossible to get rid of the acidic taste, my
      opinion. So, what I do is add Sweet Bell Peppers and a bit of hotness
      (Scotch Bonnet) to the Tomatoes to balance the taste and flavour.

      You’ll notice the recipe calls for Breadcrumbs, now, this is important.
      Breadcrumbs improve the texture of the meatballs; when/ where they’re
      added, the meatballs will be noticeably smoother and spongier. If you have
      trouble sourcing Breadcrumbs, simply soak two bread slices in 1/4 cup of
      milk until soggy, squeeze out the excess milk. Mash up the bread and
      combine with the mincemeat, same result. In case you’re wondering, the egg
      in the recipe will help to bind the meatballs and keep them from falling
      apart while cooking.
